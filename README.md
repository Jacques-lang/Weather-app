This program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the `tkinter` library in Python. The application allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather information for that city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Additionally, it displays an image at the top of the window. Here is a step-by-step description of what the program does:

1. **Imports Libraries**: 
   - `tkinter` for creating the GUI.
   - `messagebox` from `tkinter` for displaying error messages.
   - `requests` for making HTTP requests to the weather API.
   - `Image` and `ImageTk` from `PIL` for handling and displaying images.

2. **Defines `get_weather` Function**:
   - Retrieves the city name entered by the user.
   - Makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather information for the entered city.
   - If the city is not found, it shows an error message.
   - If the city is found, it updates a label with the weather information.

3. **Creates the Main Window**:
   - Initializes the main application window with the title "Weather App".

4. **Loads and Displays an Image**:
   - Loads an image from the specified path (`image.png`).
   - Displays the image in the main window using a `Label` widget.

5. **Creates and Places Widgets**:
   - Adds a label prompting the user to enter a city name.
   - Adds an entry widget for the user to input the city name.
   - Adds a button that triggers the `get_weather` function when clicked.
   - Adds a label to display the weather information.

6. **Runs the Main Event Loop**:
   - Starts the `tkinter` main event loop to keep the application running and responsive to user interactions.
